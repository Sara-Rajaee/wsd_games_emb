# Game Theory Meets Embeddings: a Unified Framework for Word Sense Disambiguation
This repository contains:
* the code of the model proposed in [Game Theory Meets Embeddings: a Unified Framework for Word Sense Disambiguation (EMNLP 2019)](http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~navigli/pubs/EMNLP_2019_TripodiNavigli.pdf)
* the code for generating the input vectors
* the evaluation framework

In order to generate the sense vectors with the vector_factory.py script it is necessary to download LMMS vectors into data/sensevectors/
